# 8mb-compressor🗜
Compresses videos of any size to 8MB or less.

## Usage
Since FFmpeg could be accommodated, it was combined into an exe file. <br>
This eliminates the need to install FFmpeg separately.<br>


<a href="https://github.com/fujilix/8mb-compressor/releases/tag/v1.0">There is a release for windows users.</a><br>
It skips the installation of the Python package and is easy to run.

 When the process is finished, output.mp4 will be output. If it is working properly, the size should be less than 8MB.
 
## ToDo📝
- Create a decent GUI and support drag-and-drop.<br>
  It seems that I need to learn Threading to develop GUI. That's a lot of work.
- Automatic update
- Optimize operation.

## Notes🙏
Some of the processing is ridiculous. Please understand that I have not done much programming.
