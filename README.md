# 8mb-compressor🗜
Compresses videos of any size to 8MB or less.

## Usage
ffmpeg is required.<br>
<a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z" target="_blank">Click here to download ffmpeg.</a><br>

<a href="https://github.com/fujilix/8mb-compressor/releases/tag/v1.0">There is a release for windows users.</a><br>
It skips the installation of the Python package and is easy to run.

The ideal directory structure is as follows:<br>
8mb-compressor<br>
　├ main.py or main.exe<br>
　└ ffmpeg.exe
 
 When the process is finished, output.mp4 will be output. If it is working properly, the size should be less than 8MB.
 
## ToDo📝
- Create a decent GUI and support drag-and-drop.
- Create a config file to use the installed FFmpeg.
- Optimize operation.

## Notes🙏
Some of the processing is ridiculous. Please understand that I have not done much programming.
