# 8mb-compressor🗜
Compresses videos of any size to 8MB or less.

## Usage
ffmpeg is required.<br>
<a href="https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z" target="_blank">Click here to download ffmpeg.</a><br>
<br>
The ideal directory structure is as follows:<br>
8mb-compressor<br>
　├ main.py<br>
　└ ffmpeg.exe
 
 
 When the process is finished, output.mp4 will be output. If it is working properly, the size should be less than 8MB.
 
## ToDo📝
- Create a decent GUI and support drag-and-drop.<br>
- Optimize operation.

## Notes🙏
Some of the processing is ridiculous. Please understand that I have not done much programming.
